# kind cluster config — 3-Node Multi-Master with Replicas
#
# Control-plane + 4 workers. With 9 Postgres instances total, you want
# enough kind nodes to spread the load. This is a heavy config for a
# laptop — make sure Docker has at least 6GB RAM allocated.
#
# Create with:
#   kind create cluster --config kind.yaml
