# Congratulations!

You've successfully deployed a **distributed, active-active PostgreSQL cluster** on Kubernetes using pgEdge.

## What you built

1. **Single Primary** — One pgEdge node with a single Postgres instance
2. **HA with Replicas** — Added synchronous replication for zero data-loss failover
3. **Multi-Master** — Added a second node with Spock active-active replication
4. **Proved it works** — Wrote on one node, read on the other
